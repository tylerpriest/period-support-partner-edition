# Competitive Analysis: Period Tracking Apps with Partner Features

## Executive Summary

The period tracking app market is large and competitive, but apps specifically designed for **partners** (rather than the person experiencing the period) are rare. Most existing solutions offer "partner features" as an add-on to primary tracking apps. This represents a significant gap and opportunity.

**Key Finding**: There's no dominant app purpose-built for partners. The market is ready for a dedicated partner support app.
