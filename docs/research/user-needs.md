## Feature Prioritization Framework

### MoSCoW Analysis

## **MUST HAVE (MVP - Minimum Viable Product)**

### 1. **Cycle Tracking & Phase Display**
**Priority:** CRITICAL
- Input/sync cycle start date
- Calculate current phase (menstrual, follicular, ovulation, luteal)
- Visual indicator of where in cycle
- Days until next period
- Simple, glanceable dashboard

**Why Critical:** This is the foundational feature - without knowing where in the cycle, nothing else works.

---

### 2. **Phase-Specific Quick Actions**
**Priority:** CRITICAL
- 3-5 immediate action suggestions per phase
- Categorized: Physical Support / Emotional Support / What to Say
- Quick-scan card format
- Update based on current phase

**Example for Menstrual Phase:**
- 🔥 Have heating pad ready
- 💊 Offer pain relief (ask preference)
- 💬 "What can I do to make you comfortable?"
- 🏠 Take on extra chores today
- ❌ Don't expect high energy

**Why Critical:** This is the core value - actionable guidance partners desperately want.

---

### 3. **Communication Do's & Don'ts**
**Priority:** CRITICAL
- Per-phase communication guide
- What TO say examples
- What NOT to say examples
- Quick reference format

**Why Critical:** Communication mistakes cause the most relationship damage. This prevents harm and builds connection.

---

### 4. **Onboarding Flow**
**Priority:** CRITICAL
- Welcome and value proposition
- Consent framework (both partners agree)
- Basic cycle education (101 level)
- Initial cycle data input
- Customization (partner's specific symptoms/preferences)

**Why Critical:** First impressions matter. Must make partner feel welcome and capable immediately.

---

### 5. **Notifications/Reminders**
**Priority:** CRITICAL
- Period starting soon (2-3 days ahead)
- PMS window beginning (3-5 days before period)
- Phase transitions
- Customizable - partner chooses what they want

**Why Critical:** Proactive reminders enable anticipatory support, which is much more appreciated than reactive.

---

### 6. **Privacy & Consent Settings**
**Priority:** CRITICAL
- Clear data sharing agreement
- Revoke access anytime
- What data is shared (transparent)
- Local data storage option

**Why Critical:** Ethical requirement. Without proper consent framework, app is creepy and potentially harmful.

---

### 18. **Voice/Chat Interface**

**Why Low:** Cool but not essential. Complex to build well.

---

### 19. **Partner Wellness Tracking**
**Priority:** LOW
