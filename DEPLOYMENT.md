## Vercel PWA Deployment (Web Testing)

The fastest way to test your app is to deploy it as a Progressive Web App (PWA) on Vercel. The app is fully configured for web deployment with `vercel.json` and `public/manifest.json` already created.

### Prerequisites

**Vercel Account** (Free tier available)
- Sign up at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
- Connect your GitHub account

### Method 1: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard (Recommended for First Deploy)

1. **Push your code to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git push origin claude/add-period-support-docs-012Mbh2B4J4TuLsv3DXrxQtU
   ```

2. **Import to Vercel**
   - Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
   - Click "Import Git Repository"
   - Select your repository: `tylerpriest/period-support-partner-edition`
   - Select the branch: `claude/add-period-support-docs-012Mbh2B4J4TuLsv3DXrxQtU`

3. **Configure Project**
   - **Framework Preset**: Other
   - **Build Command**: `npx expo export --platform web`
   - **Output Directory**: `dist`
   - **Install Command**: `npm install`

   (These settings are already configured in `vercel.json` and will be auto-detected)

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for build to complete
   - Your app will be live at: `https://period-support-partner-edition-<hash>.vercel.app`

5. **Test the PWA**
   - Open the deployment URL on your phone
   - On iOS Safari: Tap Share → "Add to Home Screen"
   - On Android Chrome: Tap menu → "Install app" or "Add to Home Screen"
   - The app will install as a PWA and work offline

### Method 2: Deploy via Vercel CLI

1. **Install Vercel CLI**
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Login to Vercel**
   ```bash
   vercel login
   # Follow the prompts to authenticate
   ```

3. **Deploy to Production**
   ```bash
   # From project root directory
   vercel --prod
   ```

4. **Follow prompts**
   - Set up and deploy? Y
   - Which scope? (Select your account)
   - Link to existing project? N (first time)
   - Project name? period-support-partner-edition
   - Directory? ./
   - Override settings? N (vercel.json is already configured)

5. **Your app is deployed!**
   - Production URL will be displayed
   - Example: `https://period-support-partner-edition.vercel.app`

### Method 3: Local Testing (Before Deploying)

Test the web build locally before deploying:

```bash
# Start Expo web development server
npx expo start --web

# Or build and preview the production build
npx expo export --platform web
npx serve dist
```

Open `http://localhost:8081` (Expo) or `http://localhost:3000` (serve) to test.

### Vercel Deployment Notes

**Build Process:**
- Vercel runs: `npm install`
- Then runs: `npx expo export --platform web`
- Outputs to: `dist/` directory
- Serves static files from `dist/`

**Environment:**
- No environment variables needed for basic deployment
- All data stored in browser LocalStorage (no backend required)

**PWA Features:**
- Installable on iOS and Android
- Works offline after first load
- Full-screen app experience
- Uses native share APIs

**Domain Setup (Optional):**
- Go to Vercel dashboard → your project → Settings → Domains
- Add custom domain: `periodsupport.app` or similar
- Vercel will guide you through DNS configuration

**Continuous Deployment:**
- Once connected, Vercel auto-deploys on every push to the branch
- Preview deployments for PRs
- Production deployments for main branch

### Vercel Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Code pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Vercel account created
- [ ] Repository imported to Vercel
- [ ] Project configured (auto-detected from vercel.json)
- [ ] Build successful (check build logs)
- [ ] App accessible at Vercel URL
- [ ] PWA installable on mobile devices
- [ ] Tested on iOS Safari
- [ ] Tested on Android Chrome
- [ ] Custom domain configured (optional)

### Troubleshooting Vercel Deployment

**Build fails with "Module not found":**
- Check that all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Run `npm install` locally to verify
- Check build logs in Vercel dashboard

**App loads but shows blank screen:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `dist/` folder was created locally with `npx expo export --platform web`
- Check that `index.html` exists in `dist/`

**PWA not installable:**
- Verify `public/manifest.json` exists
- Check that app is served over HTTPS (Vercel does this automatically)
- Check browser console for manifest errors

**Styles not loading:**
- Verify all imports use correct paths
- Check that `@expo/metro-runtime` is properly configured
- Test locally with `npx expo start --web` first

### Performance Optimization (Post-Launch)

Once deployed, you can optimize:

1. **Enable Vercel Analytics**
   - Go to project → Analytics tab
   - Monitor Core Web Vitals
   - Track page load performance

2. **Image Optimization**
   - Use Vercel Image Optimization for `<Image>` components
   - Or use `expo-image` for better performance

3. **Caching**
   - Vercel automatically caches static assets
   - Configure cache headers in `vercel.json` if needed

4. **Bundle Size**
   - Check current bundle: `npx expo export --platform web` shows size
   - Current size: ~1.43 MB (reasonable for a React Native app)
   - Optimize imports to reduce bundle size if needed
